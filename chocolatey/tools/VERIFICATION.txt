To verify the package:
1. Download the correct .exe release version from: 
   https://github.com/hoptodesk/release/commits/main/

   https://github.com/hoptodesk/release/raw/72f38e38a0596e23a6c08f2712ad0821e3d10849/HopToDesk.exe 

2. View the SHA256 for that version release by checking the hoptodesk.exe.sha256 file for that release.
   For example, release 1.42.9 is here: 
   https://github.com/hoptodesk/release/blob/72f38e38a0596e23a6c08f2712ad0821e3d10849/hoptodesk.exe.sha256

3. Calculate the SHA256 checksum of the HopToDesk.exe file using:
   - Windows: `certutil -hashfile HopToDesk.exe SHA256`
   - PowerShell: `Get-FileHash HopToDesk.exe -Algorithm SHA256`

4. Compare with the package's checksum to the checksum in the correct hoptodesk.exe.sha256 file for that release.
